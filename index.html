        I am an IT graduate. I am a master's student at SFBU. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at San Francisco Bay University. My bachelor's degree is in the field of Management of Information Systems from Zayed University, where I graduated in 2022. With one year of work experience at the MBZUAI research institute, my focus was on authentication methods in the metaverse and blockchain technologies. I worked extensively with Solidity language and Unity C# during the project.
